A good thing about our guided tours is that you can rely on our trustful guides to have an eye on you. As anywhere else in the world you can expect the odd pickpockets and conmen. But unlike other places, the locals will side with the tourists rather than their own people. Malaria is not a risk in South India. There are big mosquitoes, but they cause nothing but the usual itching. Dengue fever is endemic to South India, particularly during monsoon season, so good precautions such as strong repellants and nets are vital. We´ll update you on precautions or restricions in case of any current medical situations like pandemics.",
            q3: "How will the weather be like?",
            a3: "The South of India is only a short distance away from the equator and therefore enjoys a tropical climate. While winter is freezing Europe, we are in dry season with plenty of sunshine and warm temperatures in the lower areas without much rain or humidity. The average daily temperature there is 28°C. At the hottest point of the day the temperature can rise up to 32°C. Evenings cool down to a pleasant 23°C after sunset. In the higher areas on our routes the daytime temperatures are on average around 20 – 22 °C, while during the nights, the temperatures can go as low as 9 °C. So make sure to bring some warm clothes as well. Proper rain gear to pull over should do the job. The sea temperature is comfortably high all-year round and with 29°C even higher than the average air temperature!",
            q4: "Am I fit and experienced enough?",
            a4: "We want our riders to be fit enough to ride for 4-7 hours in a day under sunny conditions. While experience in long rides is not mandatory, it is always better that you have a few hundred kilometres of ride under your belt. Please check with your doctor if you have any preexisting medical conditions.",

Don´t worry about the motorbikes handling, the Enfield is built precisely for the broad spectrum of Indian road conditions. All our routes are tested and carefully selected by us while we go for our scouting rides. It is our constant endeavor to select routes which are safe and comfortable for our rides. There might be unexpected/last minute obstacles which are out of our control. But rest assured, we will be best prepared for such eventualities.",

For things you´ll need on the road, like a bottle of water, sunscreen lotion or camera, we recommend a separate small backpack. The space on our support truck is limited, so we request you to not exceed a luggage weight of 25 kg. We can arrange for your remaining heavy luggages to be stored safely while we are on the tour and can be retrieved at the end of the ride.",

            a9: "It has many advantages if the whole group rides the same bike. Our tour is accompanied by an Enfield mechanic and we are equipped with the most common spare parts. Also in terms of safety and cruising speed, having the same body type and engine throughout the group is of great advantage. The cost to rent one of our Enfields is included in the price. However if you want to take the ride on your own bike, please contact us for custom motorcycle adventure holidays",

            a10: "Unless you’re planning to occupy the Taj Mahal, you won’t get into trouble with the local authorities on a daily basis. But still there are a few laws and regulations to consider as a normal visitor to India: Some temples do not permit entry to non-Hindus. Strict dress codes are followed in most of the temples. Footwear is banned inside the temple premises. Nudity is not allowed in any Indian beach. Visitors to most Indian houses leave their footwear outside before entering the house. Hugging or kissing in public is not an accepted practice in India. Expect heavy penalties including imprisonment for possession of narcotic drugs.",

Es gibt große Mücken, aber die verursachen nichts als das übliche Jucken. Dengue-Fieber ist in Südindien endemisch, besonders während der Monsunzeit, daher sind gute Vorsichtsmaßnahmen wie starke Repellents und Netze unerlässlich. Wir informieren dich über Vorsichtsmaßnahmen oder Einschränkungen im Falle aktueller medizinischer Situationen wie Pandemien.",
            q3: "Wie wird das Wetter sein?",
            a3: "Südindien liegt nur eine kurze Strecke vom Äquator entfernt und genießt daher ein tropisches Klima. Während der Winter Europa frieren lässt, sind wir in der Trockenzeit mit viel Sonnenschein und warmen Temperaturen in den tieferen Lagen ohne viel Regen oder Luftfeuchtigkeit. Die durchschnittliche Tagestemperatur liegt dort bei 28°C. Am heißesten Punkt des Tages kann die Temperatur auf bis zu 32°C steigen. Abende kühlen nach Sonnenuntergang auf angenehme 23°C ab. In den höheren Lagen auf unseren Routen liegen die Tagestemperaturen im Durchschnitt bei etwa 20 – 22 °C, während die Temperaturen nachts bis auf 9 °C sinken können. Bring also unbedingt auch warme Kleidung mit. Richtige Regenkleidung zum Überziehen sollte den Job erledigen. Die Wassertemperatur ist das ganze Jahr über angenehm hoch und mit 29°C sogar höher als die durchschnittliche Lufttemperatur!",
            q4: "Bin ich fit und erfahren genug?",
            a4: "Wir möchten, dass unsere Fahrer fit genug sind, um 4-7 Stunden am Tag bei sonnigen Bedingungen zu fahren. Während Erfahrung mit langen Fahrten nicht zwingend erforderlich ist, ist es immer besser, wenn du ein paar hundert Kilometer Fahrt hinter dir hast. Bitte kläre mit deinem Arzt ab, ob du irgendwelche Vorerkrankungen hast.",
            q5: "Wie sind die Straßenverhältnisse in Indien?",
            a5: "Auf unserer Route werden wir über so ziemlich alles fahren, was unter Straßenoberflächen beschrieben werden kann. Wir gleiten über brandneue Bergkurven und cruisen über vierspurige Autobahnen, die abrupt auf schlaglochübersäte Landstraßen führen, begegnen engen Gassen in der Innenstadt sowie manövrieren langsam über Schotter- und Sandabschnitte. Mach dir keine Sorgen um das Handling der Motorräder, die Enfield ist genau für das breite Spektrum der indischen Straßenverhältnisse gebaut. Alle unsere Routen werden von uns getestet und sorgfältig ausgewählt, während wir unsere Erkundungsfahrten machen. Es ist unser ständiges Bestreben, Routen auszuwählen, die für unsere Fahrten sicher und komfortabel sind. Es kann unerwartete/last-minute Hindernisse geben, die außerhalb unserer Kontrolle liegen. Aber sei versichert, wir werden auf solche Eventualitäten bestens vorbereitet sein.",
            q6: "Werde ich Magen-Darm-Erkrankungen bekommen?",
            a6: "Biken macht mit Magenverstimmung keinen Spaß. Und während wir die Gesamtreaktion deines Systems auf indische Bedingungen nicht garantieren können, legen wir höchsten Wert auf hygienische Standards in den Küchen unserer Partner. Alle Zutaten sind frisch, mit Flaschenwasser gewaschen und kein ungares Essen berührt die Teller.",
            q7: "Was ist, wenn ich spezielle Ernährungsbedürfnisse habe?",
            a7: "Bitte lass es uns im Voraus wissen, damit wir die Verfügbarkeit bestätigen können.",
            q8: "Was ist mit Gepäck?",
            a8: "Dein allgemeines Gepäck reist direkt hinter dir auf unserem Servicewagen, um dich von dieser Last zu befreien. Aber da dies eine Motorradtour ist, empfehlen wir Fahrern, mit leichtem Gepäck zu reisen. Für Dinge, die du unterwegs brauchst, wie eine Flasche Wasser, Sonnencreme oder Kamera, empfehlen wir einen separaten kleinen Rucksack. Der Platz auf unserem Begleitwagen ist begrenzt, daher bitten wir dich, ein Gepäckgewicht von 25 kg nicht zu überschreiten. Wir können arrangieren, dass dein restliches schweres Gepäck sicher aufbewahrt wird, während wir auf Tour sind, und am Ende der Fahrt abgeholt werden kann.",
            q9: "Kann ich mein eigenes Motorrad mitbringen?",
            a9: "Es hat viele Vorteile, wenn die ganze Gruppe das gleiche Motorrad fährt. Unsere Tour wird von einem Enfield-Mechaniker begleitet und wir sind mit den gängigsten Ersatzteilen ausgestattet. Auch in Bezug auf Sicherheit und Reisegeschwindigkeit ist es von großem Vorteil, denselben Karosserietyp und Motor in der ganzen Gruppe zu haben. Die Kosten für die Miete einer unserer Enfields sind im Preis inbegriffen. Wenn du die Fahrt jedoch auf deinem eigenen Motorrad machen möchtest, kontaktiere uns bitte für individuelle Motorradabenteuerurlaube",
            q10: "Welche Gesetze gelten im Unterschied zu europäischen Standards?",
            a10: "Sofern du nicht vorhast, das Taj Mahal zu besetzen, wirst du im Alltag keinen Ärger mit den lokalen Behörden bekommen. Aber dennoch gibt es ein paar Gesetze und Vorschriften, die man als normaler Besucher in Indien beachten sollte: Einige Tempel erlauben Nicht-Hindus keinen Zutritt. In den meisten Tempeln gelten strenge Kleidervorschriften. Schuhwerk ist auf dem Tempelgelände verboten. Nacktheit ist an keinem indischen Strand erlaubt. Besucher der meisten indischen Häuser lassen ihre Schuhe draußen stehen, bevor sie das Haus betreten. Umarmen oder Küssen in der Öffentlichkeit ist in Indien keine akzeptierte Praxis. Rechne mit schweren Strafen bis hin zu Gefängnis für den Besitz von Betäubungsmitteln.",
            q11: "Muss ich ein Handtuch mitbringen?",
            a11: "Nein, die Gästehäuser stellen welche zur Verfügung. Halte dein Gepäck leicht, aber vergiss nicht, deine Badesachen einzupacken.",
            q12: "Was ist, wenn ich einen Unfall habe?",
            a12: "Hoffentlich hast du dich nicht verletzt! Unsere eigene Versicherung deckt Sachschäden, die du am Motorrad verursachst, sowie Sach- und Personenschäden, die du Dritten mit dem Motorrad zufügst. Falls du dich verletzt hast, führen wir ein umfassendes Erste-Hilfe-Set mit und unsere gesamte Crew ist in Erster Hilfe ausgebildet. Der Süden verfügt über ein fortschrittliches Notfallmedizinsystem, so dass du im Ernstfall schnell in den vertrauensvollen Händen eines professionellen Mediziners wärst. Deine Reiseversicherung springt ein, um diese Kosten zu decken. Eine der wenigen Anforderungen, die wir an dich stellen, ist, dass du eine Reiseversicherung für das Ausland abschließt.",
            q13: "Was ist, wenn ich meine Buchung stornieren muss?",
            a13: "Das ist sehr schade, aber natürlich möglich. Die detaillierten Stornierungsbedingungen findest du in unseren Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen."
